# Surf's Up

## Overview
Performing an analysis on temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, to determine if a surf and ice cream business is sustainable year-around.

## Results
- The count of temperatures for the month of Decemeber is 1517 and the count of temperatures for the month of June is 1700.

- The average temperature in Decemeber is approximately 71 degrees fahrenheit, and the average temperature in June is approximately 75.

- The minimum recorded temperature in December is 56, and the minimum recorded temperature in June is 64.

## Summary
The average and maximum temperatures in Oahu are within five degrees of each other in June and December. However, the minimum temperature is about 10 degrees lower in December compared to June. Based on temperature data alone, I think a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year-around in Oahu. The temperatures are still warm enough to go to the beach in December.
To make a more informed business decision, I would perform additional queries to determine the summary statistics for each month of the year. I would also perform an additional query to add a precipitation column for each month.
